The design here is similar to soma, with a network layer handling
all arbitration, retransmission, and packetizing. 

Perhaps the only in-process event source will be the timer? 

EventCycle count: a 64-bit event cycle index. different from the
system timer as we might want the system timer to start at a
different offset for testing. 

EventRouterBuffer
============================================

The EventRouterBuffer basically works like the event buffer, taking
in EventTX_t packets from each of N sources, redistributing them 

eventRouter.add(eventsrc_t, EventTX_t)
ecyclecnt_t eventRouter.ecycle()
eventRotuer.gatherEvents(eventsrc_t ): get events pending for this source

FIXME: Do we want to use the boost::circular buffer here?
