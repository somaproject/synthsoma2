The design here is similar to soma, with a network layer handling all
arbitration, retransmission, and packetizing.

Perhaps the only in-process event source will be the timer?

EventCycle count: a 64-bit event cycle index. different from the
system timer as we might want the system timer to start at a different
offset for testing.



Design Goals
-----------------------------------------

Sufficiently fast. That means that it's going
to have to be able to send out:
   Minimum 2000 event packets / sec
   32 data sources at 1ksps 768-byte packets

Multithreaded : Devices (both event and data) will
be independently threaded, to both take advantage
of contemporary multi-core processors and prevent
blocking. 

Code Reuse / real reuse: Be able to use the actual
dspboard code

Ease of implementation: be able to write python modules
that emulate events

We want this to work for both domain sockets and network sockets.

The entire thing is controlled and scripted via python
thanks to the magic that is boost::python
