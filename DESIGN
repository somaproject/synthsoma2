The design here is similar to soma, with a network layer handling
all arbitration, retransmission, and packetizing. 

Perhaps the only in-process event source will be the timer? 

Look, this thing is going to be spinning really hard, do we really
need boost::asio? 


Core mechanism looks like this for events. Data is its own world. 

EventRouterBuffer: 


eventRouter.add(src, EventTX_t)
eventRouter.ecycle()
eventRotuer.gatherEvents()
