The design here is similar to soma, with a network layer handling all
arbitration, retransmission, and packetizing.

Perhaps the only in-process event source will be the timer?

EventCycle count: a 64-bit event cycle index. different from the
system timer as we might want the system timer to start at a different
offset for testing.
