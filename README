Synthetic Soma 2 v 1.0 

This is our second incarnation of Synthetic Soma. It
allows us to benchmark and test Soma applications without
having to worry about the Soma hardware. 

Projects: 
--------------------------------------------------------------------
   libsynthsoma2  : the c++ library
   pysynthsoma2   : The python bindings to the c++ library, 
                    along with some utility features
   soma-synth     : The synthetic soma runner, with optional gui (in python).
                    Easy to use, by default does "right thing" 


Note: While this is designed to be a feature-complete version,
current computers _really have a hard time keeping up_ with the
data transmission requirements. Doing _anything_ 50k times/sec is 
quite demanding. Benchmarks suggest that simply acquiring a mutex
can only be done about 20M times per second, which is only ~400 per
ECYCLE (not too many for a lot of devices). Also, condition variables 
are even slower, at 3.3M/sec.
