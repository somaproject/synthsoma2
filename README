This is our attempt at a v2 of SynthSoma. 

Goals: 

Sufficiently performant. That means that it's going
to have to be able to send out 2000 packets for second
minimum (for events)

Multithreaded : Devices (both event and data) will
be independently threaded

Code Reuse / real reuse: Be able to use the actual
dspio code

Ease of implementation: be able to write python modules
that emulate events

We want this to work for both domain sockets and local
