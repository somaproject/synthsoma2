Synthetic Soma 2 v 1.0 

This is our second incarnation of Synthetic Soma. It
allows us to benchmark and test Soma applications without
having to worry about the Soma hardware. 

Projects: 
--------------------------------------------------------------------
   libsynthsoma2  : the c++ library
   pysynthsoma2   : The python bindings to the c++ library, 
                    along with some utility features
   soma-synth     : The synthetic soma runner, with optional gui (in python).
                    Easy to use, by default does "right thing"
