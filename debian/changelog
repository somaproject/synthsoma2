synthsoma2 (0.9~somatesting-jaunty-github-090804172856) jaunty; urgency=low

  * initial release of SynthSoma2
  * initial test framework for building.
  * Created benchmarks added logging infrastructure
  * event router passes tests
  * Created the NetEventSender which should dispatch inbound events out
    the data interface.
  * Everything seems to work, except the final delete dies.
  * Fixed object-order-creation issues, now we don't segfault!
  * NetDataSender works with somanetwork
  * Created event and databus objects created synthsomarunner created
    devices, including timer, to test.
  * Created synthsoma2-level test utils, should delete old ones have
    benchmark that is giving me fits with domain sockets
  * Set socket to non-blocking, trap all socket-related errors.
  * Initial creation of python modules.
  * Build with indexing suite start creating tests
  * Have most primary types being successfully created
  * NetDataSender appears to work for TSpikes
  * at the very least, the basic things run -- i have no idea if they
    really work or not
  * Data bus appears to at least send tspikes via domain sockets
  * Successfully sends tspikes to tspikes
  * Updated simpletspike to be able to send differing spikes TSpike and
    TSpikeWave now can cross the python boundary, although poorly.
  * added initial INet for network events fleshed out domain sockets for
    data
  * Added remaining devices
  * can successfully send to four devices
  * added performance monitor
  * updates
  * minor updates
  * created benchtest.
  * created eventbench, we really need to optimize things here.
  * Removed eventourter, subsumed activity into simplified event bus
    benchmark/eventbus.cc suggests we can do 64 spike sinks and ALMOST 4
    Timer sources.
  * updates to bench
  * Preliminary tests of event receiver works. Time for a push-out.
  * Updates to docs, runtime program.
  * Reorganization of the repository in preparation for deployment.
  * created some example runtime programs
  * Removed extra dependency on HDF5
  * More reorganization of project for installation
  * At least with virtualenv, it seems that installation works
  * New files for build system
  * Added dspboard child
  * Soma DSPboard interface can now successfully send and receive events
  * Synth works for TSpikes, still need to do waves, retransmission
  * Added resonable tspike generation.
  * added better tspike defaults
