Additional CMAKE files: 

FindHDF5.cmake
-------------------
We stole (and hacked up) FindHDF5.cmake from the paraview project on github


FindPythonLibrary.cmake and PythonMacros.cmake
-----------------------------------------------

The KDE project has additional very useful .cmake files, at

http://websvn.kde.org/trunk/KDE/kdelibs/cmake/modules/

Their copyright policy is in KDE_cmake_copy, but it's just BSD. 

FindPythonLibrary.cmake and PythonMacros.cmake are from there.
